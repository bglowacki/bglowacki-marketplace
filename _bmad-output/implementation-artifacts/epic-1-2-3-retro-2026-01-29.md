**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Epics Reviewed:** Epic 1 (Usage Visibility), Epic 2 (Missed Opportunity Detection), Epic 3 (Actionable Output)
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)

## Participants

- Alice (Product Owner)
- Bob (Scrum Master) - facilitating
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- Bartek (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stories Completed | 9/9 (100%) |
| Test Suite | 365 tests, all passing |
| Duration | ~2 days (Jan 28-29, 2026) |
| Files Modified | 2 primary: `collect_usage.py`, `usage-insights-agent.md` |
| Schema Evolution | v3.0 → v3.13 (4 bumps) |
| Code Reviews | Every story reviewed (adversarial) |

### Epic Breakdown

| Epic | Stories | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Epic 1: Usage Visibility | 1.1, 1.2 | Session collection, skill classification (Active/Dormant/Unused) |
| Epic 2: Missed Opportunity Detection | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 | Test suite, confidence scoring, impact scoring |
| Epic 3: Actionable Output | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 | Empty states, dashboard, findings walk-through, safe cleanup |

## Successes

- **100% delivery** - all 9 stories, all FRs (FR-1.x through FR-3.x), all NFRs met
- **365 tests** providing real safety net; TDD approach in Epic 2 was particularly effective
- **Code reviews caught real bugs** - Story 1.2 review found critical `project_path` not populated in `main()`; Story 1.1 review caught scope creep
- **Clean architecture maintained** throughout - single-file constraint (ADR-042), dataclass usage, ADR compliance
- **Dependency chain executed cleanly** - Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 3 built on each other as planned

## Challenges

- **Process overhead disproportionate to project size** - full epic/story/dev/review ceremony for a solo developer on a personal tool with 2 primary files
- **9 unresolved review items from Story 1.1** - dead code (4 unused functions, ~75 LOC), out-of-scope session type tracking, undocumented changes to `generate_session_summary.py`
- **Schema designed incrementally** - 4 version bumps in 2 days; could have been 1 with upfront data model design
- **Story 2.1 absorbed into 2.2** - artificial separation; test suite was built as part of confidence scoring work, story file left in `ready-for-dev` state
- **Scope creep in Story 1.1** - dev added unrequested functions and modified out-of-scope files

## Key Insights

1. **Right-size process to project** - full Scrum ceremony doesn't match solo dev + personal tool; quick-flow (tech spec → implement → review) is more appropriate
2. **TDD and code reviews earn their keep** - these quality gates caught real issues and should be retained regardless of process weight
3. **Design data model holistically upfront** - avoids schema churn and incremental rework
4. **Story granularity matters** - some stories (2.1/2.2) were artificial separations that added ceremony without value

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| # | Action | Owner | Success Criteria |
|---|--------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Use quick-flow for future work on this project | Bartek | Next feature uses quick-spec → implement → review |
| 2 | Design data model upfront before implementation | Architect | Schema finalized in tech spec, max 1 version bump per epic |

### Technical Debt

| # | Action | Owner | Priority |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 3 | Resolve 9 open review items from Story 1.1 (remove dead code, out-of-scope additions, clean up generate_session_summary.py) | Dev | Medium |
| 4 | Fix Story 2.1 record - update story file status, document absorption into 2.2 | Scrum Master | Low |

### Team Agreements

- For personal/solo projects, default to quick-flow workflow
- Keep code reviews - they catch real bugs
- Keep TDD - the test suite is a genuine asset
- Cut ceremony that doesn't add proportional value

## Next Steps

- No Epic 4 defined - MVP is complete
- Address technical debt (action items 3-4) when convenient
- Apply quick-flow process for any future plugin development
